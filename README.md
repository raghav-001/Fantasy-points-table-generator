# Fantasy-points-table-generator
Do you like to play games using fantasy with friends and tired of calculating points manually?
<h3>Points table generator</h3><hr>
Here is a Java code using file handling to generate points table among friends using the fantasy points obtained in a game for any sport.<br>Enter the names of your friends in an excel sheet, with the first column as serial number, second column as player names, and the other columns filled with the points that each player obtained in the fantasy match, and store it in your desktop.<br>Run the source code, and it will automatically print:
<ul>
  <li>The player name, and the number of matches that the player picked a team in the fantasy game.</li>
  <li>The penalty for each player, that is, if a player misses to pick a team for a match, then the player will be charged a penalty of 2 points, so that it will be fair when calculating the average points for all the players, and this way, a player who doesn't pick a team for a match will not have an advantage over the one who picked a team for all matches.</li>
  <li>A ranklist with the player name, along with the average rank gained by the player on every fantasy game, including the penalty. The rank is based on this average rank, where lower the average rank, it will imply that the player ranked well throughout the tournament</li>
</ul><br>Have a good tournament filled with fun along with your friends:smile:!
